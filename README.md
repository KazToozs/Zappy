# Zappy
Game project coded primarily in C composed of an AI client which connects at distance through TCP to a game server. A graphical interface can also be connected to it in order to see the state of the game running on the remote server.

OF NOTE: Due to file size restrictions, the project is currently missing a set of Unity 3D assets.
